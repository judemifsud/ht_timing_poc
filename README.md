# ht_timing_poc
POC for Hillingdon Tri Timing Application

The initial goal is to produce a Proof of Concept solution that allows developers to build a reader application to capture RFID events using standard protocols without the need for specific hardware. By adhering to industry standard protocols the solutions should be transferrable across different RFID reader Hardware with minimal configuration. Along with the advantage of allowing the solution to be developed without specific hardware this approach also provides a platform for automated software builds and automated testing.
